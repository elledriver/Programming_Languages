# Programming Languages

An essential part of my Cybersecurity master plan is secure software development. Is not possible to know all the languages that currently exist but, at least, I must know some of them in depth.

Some of these languages are old friends that I need to update and others are new to me. Whatever, I'll start from zero with all of them.

My "wishes list": C/C++, Python, Java, PHP... and more

This repository is a journey through different languages. The main idea is to follow the same route with all of them, so the exercises will be similar, whenever possible.

OS: Windows 10
IDE: Visual Studio Code
