# Programming_Languages

This is a personal challenge: Learn a few programming languages from zero to security software development. 
The "wishes list": 
C/C++ 
Python 
Java
PHP
... and more

This repository is a roadmap for each one, organized by folders. From really basics exercises, with comments to learn and/or compare with other languages, to the final project.

Let's start with C and Python.

Wish me luck.
